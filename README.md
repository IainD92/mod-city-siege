</p>

Overview
--------
The City Siege module for AzerothCore adds dynamic, timed siege events to all major cities in World of Warcraft. On a random, configurable timer, opposing faction forces assault a major city, spawning enemy units outside the city limits who march toward the city leader while engaging defenders. Enemy forces spawn at the city outskirts and use pathfinding and waypoints to march into the city, attacking the faction leader as their primary objective. 

**Both factions can win rewards:** Defenders earn rewards if they protect their city leader until the event ends, while attackers earn rewards if they successfully kill the city leader. This creates competitive PvE content where both Alliance and Horde players have incentive to participate. The module features fully configurable spawn locations, creature entries, reward scaling, and RP elements to create exciting world events that encourage faction participation and creates a more dynamic, living world experience.

> [!CAUTION]
> THIS MODULE IS IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT. IT PROBABLY WON’T WORK, WILL SOMETIMES WORK POORLY, AND MAY RANDOMLY DECIDE TO TAKE A VACATION. DO NOT USE ON AN ACTIVE SERVER OR EXPECT ANYTHING RESEMBLING RELIABILITY UNTIL THIS NOTICE IS GONE.

Features
--------
- **Dynamic Siege Events:**  
  Random timer-based events that bring warfare to major cities with configurable intervals.
- **All Major Cities Supported:**  
  Alliance: Stormwind, Ironforge, Darnassus, Exodar  
  Horde: Orgrimmar, Undercity, Thunder Bluff, Silvermoon
- **Waypoint System:**  
  Siege units follow configurable waypoint paths to navigate through cities to reach their targets. Each city can have multiple waypoints configured for optimal pathing.
- **Dynamic Unit Respawning:**  
  Fallen siege units automatically respawn during active sieges with configurable respawn timers based on unit type (Leaders: 5 min, Mini-bosses: 3 min, Elites: 2 min, Minions: 1 min, Defenders: 45 sec). Attackers respawn at siege spawn point, defenders respawn near city leader. Creates sustained pressure throughout the event.
- **4-Tier Enemy System:**  
  Regular minions, Elite soldiers, Mini-bosses, and Faction leaders with configurable spawn counts, levels, and scale sizes.
- **City Defender System:**  
  Configurable defender units spawn near the city leader and march backwards through waypoints to meet attackers, creating dynamic frontlines throughout the city.
- **Waypoint Visualization:**  
  GM command to toggle tall beam-style markers showing spawn points, waypoint paths, and leader positions for easy diagnosis of pathfinding issues.
- **Cinematic RP Phase:**  
  Configurable delay where siege forces stand passive and yell RP messages before combat begins to give players time to join in and get ready.
- **Weather Override System:**  
  Temporarily overrides zone weather during the RP phase to create dramatic atmospheric effects (storm, rain, snow, or clear weather).
- **Periodic Yells:**  
  Leaders and mini-bosses yell threatening messages every 30 seconds during combat for immersion.
- **Flexible Event Timing:**  
  Configurable minimum (120min default) and maximum (240min default) intervals between events.
- **Event Duration Control:**  
  Configurable siege duration (default 30 minutes).
- **Single or Multiple Sieges:**  
  Choose whether only one city can be under siege at a time, or allow multiple simultaneous events.
- **City-Specific Configuration:**  
  Enable or disable events for individual cities.
- **Reward System:**  
  Automatic honor (100 default) and level-scaled gold rewards for winning faction players (base 50 silver + 50 silver per level).

Playerbot Support
-----------------
This module can optionally recruit Playerbots (random bots) to participate in sieges when the `MOD_PLAYERBOTS` build option is enabled and the Playerbots module is active.

- Recruitment source: `RandomPlayerbotMgr` (rndbots). The module prefers randomly-managed bots and will not recruit alternate-character/explicitly-managed accounts.
- Exclusions: Bots that are dead, in combat, inside instances/battlegrounds, or currently in a party/raid will be skipped.
- Level and count: Recruited bots respect `Playerbots.MinLevel`, `Playerbots.MaxAttackers` and `Playerbots.MaxDefenders` configuration values.
- Behavior: Recruited bots are teleported to spawn points or near the city leader and will be returned to their original location and strategies after the siege ends.

Notes
-----
- Ensure the Playerbots module is enabled and configured before enabling playerbot recruitment for sieges.

GM Commands
-----------
Game Masters with `SEC_GAMEMASTER` security level have access to manual siege control commands. Administrators with `SEC_ADMINISTRATOR` level can also reload configuration. These commands allow you to trigger, stop, and manage siege events for testing or special events.

### Available Commands

- `.citysiege start [cityname]` - Manually start a siege event
- `.citysiege stop <cityname> <faction>` - Stop an active siege and declare a winner
- `.citysiege cleanup [cityname]` - Force cleanup of siege creatures
- `.citysiege status` - Display current siege events and module status
- `.citysiege info` - Inspect the currently selected siege NPC or playerbot
- `.citysiege testwaypoint` - Spawn a temporary test marker at your position (20 seconds)
- `.citysiege waypoints <cityname>` - Toggle visualization of siege waypoint path
- `.citysiege reload` - Reload configuration from file (Administrator only)

#### `.citysiege start [cityname]`
Starts a siege event immediately in the specified city or a random enabled city if no name is provided.

**Usage:**
```
.citysiege start                  # Start siege in random enabled city
.citysiege start Stormwind        # Start siege in Stormwind
.citysiege start orgrimmar        # Start siege in Orgrimmar (case-insensitive)
```

**Notes:**
- City name matching is case-insensitive
- Validates city exists and is enabled in configuration
- Will not start if a siege is already active in that city
- Respects `CitySiege.AllowMultipleCities` setting

#### `.citysiege stop <cityname> <alliance|horde>`
Stops an active siege event and declares a winner. The GM specifies which faction wins, and players of that faction receive rewards.

**Usage:**
```
.citysiege stop Stormwind alliance    # Alliance wins - all Alliance players get rewards
.citysiege stop Stormwind horde       # Horde wins - all Horde players get rewards
.citysiege stop Orgrimmar horde       # Horde wins - all Horde players get rewards
.citysiege stop Orgrimmar alliance    # Alliance wins - all Alliance players get rewards
```

**Notes:**
- **Faction parameter is required** - GM manually decides which faction wins the battle
- **Winning faction's players receive rewards** regardless of which city is under siege
- If Alliance wins: Alliance players within range get honor and gold
- If Horde wins: Horde players within range get honor and gold
- Losing faction receives no rewards
- Despawns all siege creatures
- Removes event from active list

#### `.citysiege cleanup [cityname]`
Force despawns all siege creatures and clears event data. Use this if a siege becomes stuck or has issues.

**Usage:**
```
.citysiege cleanup                # Cleanup all active sieges
.citysiege cleanup Darnassus      # Cleanup Darnassus siege only
```

**Notes:**
- Force removes creatures **without** reward distribution
- Clears all event data and timers
- Use this for troubleshooting problematic events
- Does not trigger normal end-of-event procedures
- No winner determination or rewards

#### `.citysiege status`
Displays the current status of the City Siege module and all active events.

**Usage:**
```
.citysiege status
```

**Output includes:**
- Module enabled/disabled state
- Number of active sieges
- Details for each active siege:
  - City name
  - Time remaining in the event
  - Number of creatures alive
- Time until next automatic siege event

#### `.citysiege info`
Displays waypoint and target information for the currently selected siege NPC or playerbot.

**Usage:**
```
.citysiege info
```

**Notes:**
- Requires a siege NPC or siege playerbot to be selected first
- Useful for diagnosing waypoint progress and stuck units
- Reports the unit's current target and distance to that target

#### `.citysiege testwaypoint`
Spawns a temporary waypoint marker at your current position for 20 seconds. Use this to preview and test waypoint positions before adding them to the config file.

**Usage:**
```
.citysiege testwaypoint            # Spawn test marker at current position
```

**Output:**
- Spawns a white spotlight beam (scale 2.5) at your location
- Displays your exact coordinates (X, Y, Z) with +1 yard Z buffer built-in
- Marker automatically despawns after 20 seconds

**Notes:**
- Stand where you want a waypoint, then use this command
- The marker shows exactly what the waypoint will look like
- **Z coordinate automatically includes +1 yard buffer** to prevent ground clipping
- Copy the displayed coordinates to your config file
- Perfect for building and testing waypoint paths
- The buffer prevents units from sinking into the ground during movement

#### `.citysiege waypoints <cityname>`
Toggles visualization of the siege waypoint path for a specific city. Shows tall beam-style markers to help diagnose pathfinding issues.

**Usage:**
```
.citysiege waypoints Stormwind     # Toggle waypoint visualization for Stormwind
.citysiege waypoints Darnassus     # Toggle waypoint visualization for Darnassus
```

**Visual Markers:**
- **Spawn Position** (scale 3.0): Large green spotlight beam marking attacker spawn point
- **Waypoint Path** (scale 2.5): Medium white spotlight beams marking each waypoint along the route
- **Leader Position** (scale 3.0): Large green spotlight beam marking where the leader stops (same as spawn)

**Output:**
- Shows how many waypoints are configured for the city
- Reports successful marker spawns and any failures
- Displays total marker count breakdown (spawn + waypoints + leader)
- Path guide: Spawn (Green/Large) -> Waypoints (White/Medium) -> Leader (Green/Large)

**Notes:**
- Run the command again to hide the waypoints
- Markers are visible from afar for easy diagnosis
- Large green beams mark start (spawn) and end (leader) positions
- Medium white beams mark the path waypoints in between
- Useful for identifying problematic waypoint positions
- Helps visualize the complete attack path
- Each city's waypoints can be toggled independently
- If markers are missing, check the output messages for spawn failures
- Enable debug mode to see detailed spawn logs in server console

#### `.citysiege reload`
Reloads all configuration values from `mod_city_siege.conf` without restarting the server. Allows you to make changes to waypoints, timers, spawn counts, and other settings on the fly.

**Usage:**
```
.citysiege reload
```

**What Gets Reloaded:**
- All timer settings (min/max spawn timer, event duration)
- Spawn counts (minions, elites, mini-bosses, leaders, defenders)
- Level and scale settings
- City enable/disable flags
- Waypoint configurations for all cities
- Spawn and leader positions
- Creature entry IDs
- Aggro and respawn settings
- Reward settings
- Messages and yells

**Output:**
- Confirmation message when reload is complete
- Displays current status (enabled/disabled, debug mode, timers, duration)
- Lists waypoint counts for each city that has waypoints configured
- Note about active sieges continuing with old settings

**Notes:**
- Requires Administrator security level (SEC_ADMINISTRATOR)
- Active sieges will continue using their original configuration
- Only new sieges started after reload will use updated settings
- Useful for testing different waypoint configurations without server restarts
- Perfect for adjusting spawn counts, timers, and other balance settings
- Changes to waypoints take effect immediately for new siege events

### Command Examples

```
# Test a siege event in Stormwind
.citysiege start Stormwind

# Check how the event is progressing
.citysiege status

# Building waypoint paths - spawn a test marker at your current position
.citysiege testwaypoint

# Visualize the complete waypoint path to diagnose pathing issues
.citysiege waypoints Stormwind

# Hide the waypoint markers when done diagnosing
.citysiege waypoints Stormwind

# Reload configuration after making changes to the .conf file
.citysiege reload

# GM observes and decides Alliance wins - Alliance players get rewards
.citysiege stop Stormwind alliance

# Or if GM decides Horde wins - Horde players get rewards
.citysiege stop Stormwind horde

# If creatures get stuck, force cleanup (no rewards, no winner)
.citysiege cleanup Stormwind
```

CitySiege.Stormwind.Waypoint2.Z = 97.400345
CitySiege.Stormwind.Waypoint3.X = -8609.125
CitySiege.Stormwind.Waypoint3.Y = 507.26778
CitySiege.Stormwind.Waypoint3.Z = 103.72089
```

**Notes:**
- Waypoints guide units through the city: Spawn → WP1 → WP2 → WP3 → Leader
- Units progress to next waypoint when within 10 yards of current waypoint
- Units resume movement to their current waypoint after combat ends
- Setting WaypointCount to 0 makes units path directly to the leader
- Use `.gps` command in-game to get coordinates for waypoints

Customization
-------------
### Adding Custom Creatures

To use custom creatures for siege events:

1. Create or select creature entries in your database.
2. Update the `mod_city_siege.conf` file with your custom creature entry IDs.
3. Restart the worldserver for changes to take effect.

### Customizing Messages and Yells

All announcement messages and creature yells are configurable in `mod_city_siege.conf`:

1. **Announcement Messages:**  
  Edit `CitySiege.Message.SiegeStart`, `CitySiege.Message.SiegeEnd`, and `CitySiege.Message.Reward` to customize text. Use `{CITYNAME}` for the city name and `{ACTION}` in the reward message for defending/conquering.

2. **Creature Yells:**  
   - `CitySiege.Yell.LeaderSpawn`: Message leaders yell when they spawn
   - `CitySiege.Yell.Combat`: Semicolon-separated list of random combat yells. Leaders and mini-bosses will randomly select one message to yell every 30 seconds (configurable via `CitySiege.YellFrequency`).

3. Restart the worldserver for changes to take effect.

Example custom combat yells:
```
CitySiege.Yell.Combat = "We will crush you!;Bow before us!;Your end is near!;Resistance is futile!"
```

### Adjusting Spawn Locations

Spawn coordinates for each city are fully configurable in `mod_city_siege.conf`:

1. Use `.gps` command in-game to get coordinates outside city gates.
2. Update `CitySiege.CITYNAME.SpawnX/Y/Z` in your config file.
3. Restart the worldserver for changes to take effect.

Example for Stormwind:
```
CitySiege.Stormwind.SpawnX = -8500.0
CitySiege.Stormwind.SpawnY = 600.0
CitySiege.Stormwind.SpawnZ = 95.0
```

Enemies will spawn in a 30-yard radius circular formation around this point.

### Configuring Waypoints

Waypoints allow you to create custom paths for siege units through each city:

1. **Enable waypoints for a city:**
   ```
   CitySiege.Stormwind.WaypointCount = 3
   ```

2. **Position yourself in-game** at key locations using `.gps` to get coordinates:
   - City entrance/gates
   - Main roads or districts
   - Near the leader location

3. **Use `.citysiege testwaypoint`** to preview the waypoint marker at your current position:
   - Spawns a temporary visual marker for 20 seconds
   - Displays exact coordinates to copy
   - Shows exactly how the waypoint will appear

4. **Add waypoint coordinates** to your config file:
   ```
   CitySiege.Stormwind.Waypoint1.X = -8829.0
   CitySiege.Stormwind.Waypoint1.Y = 640.530
   CitySiege.Stormwind.Waypoint1.Z = 94.11582
   ```

5. **Repeat for each waypoint** (numbered sequentially: Waypoint1, Waypoint2, Waypoint3, etc.)

6. **Restart the worldserver** for changes to take effect.

7. **Verify with `.citysiege waypoints CITYNAME`** to visualize the complete path.

**Tips:**
- Waypoints should form a logical path from spawn point to leader
- Space waypoints 50-100 yards apart for smooth movement
- Use `.citysiege testwaypoint` at each position before adding to config
- Use `.citysiege waypoints CITYNAME` to see the full path visualization
- Test with `.citysiege start CITYNAME` to verify pathing
- Set WaypointCount to 0 to disable waypoints and use direct pathing

Debugging
---------
To enable detailed debug logging, update the configuration file:

    CitySiege.DebugMode = 1

This will output comprehensive information about:
- Configuration loading (including waypoint paths)
- Event scheduling
- Creature spawning
- Waypoint progression (which waypoint each unit is moving toward)
- Respawn timers and respawn events
- AI state changes
- Reward distribution

Troubleshooting
---------------
> **Events are not starting.**  
> Ensure that `CitySiege.Enabled = 1` and at least one city is enabled in the configuration file. Check server logs for any errors.

> **No announcements appearing.**  
> Verify `CitySiege.AnnounceRadius` is set correctly. This radius applies to siege start/end, countdown, battle start, and periodic status messages. Set to 0 for world-wide announcements.

> **Configuration changes not taking effect.**  
> Confirm the config file is in the correct location (`/path/to/server/etc/modules/mod_city_siege.conf`), check file permissions, and restart the worldserver after making changes.

> **Creatures not spawning.**  
> Enable debug mode and check logs for spawning errors. Verify that the configured creature entries exist in your database.

> **Creatures clipping through walls or ground.**  
> Ensure waypoints are configured for the city. Units need proper waypoint paths to navigate complex city layouts. Use `.gps` to get coordinates along the intended path and configure waypoints in the config file.

> **Creatures not moving or getting stuck.**  
> Check that waypoint coordinates are valid and accessible. Verify waypoints form a logical path with no obstructions. Enable debug mode to see which waypoint each unit is targeting. Use `.citysiege waypoints <cityname>` to visualize the complete path and identify problematic positions. The module includes automatic ground validation to prevent units from moving to invalid positions in mid-air or underground.

> **Respawned units not appearing.**  
> Verify `CitySiege.Respawn.Enabled = 1` in config. Check that the siege is still active (respawning stops when event ends). Enable debug mode to see respawn timer logs.

> **Rewards not being distributed.**  
> Ensure `CitySiege.RewardOnDefense = 1` and that players meet the minimum level requirement. Players must be within the announcement radius of the city center when the event ends successfully.
